# Dune 3v3

Private web-table implementation for a six-player `Dune: Imperium - Uprising` team game.

## Current Slice

- Vite + React + TypeScript client.
- Six seats split into Muad'Dib and Shaddam teams.
- Hotseat turn flow for agent turns and reveal turns.
- Board space model for the 6-player surface.
- Resource, influence, conflict, hand, and Imperium row UI foundations.
- Asset pipeline conventions for owned scans or public reference images.

## Run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite.

## Asset Policy

The app is designed to use local physical-copy scans or other assets the play group supplies in `public/assets`. The first checked-in version uses generated CSS treatments and structured metadata so the game can run before final board/card art is wired in.
